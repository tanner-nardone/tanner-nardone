- 👋 Hi, I’m @tanner-nardone a Research Engineer based in Atlanta, GA at Georgia Tech Research Institute
- 👀 I’m interested in Model Based System Engineering, and improving my scripting in python and eventually learning more languages
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more python, jupyter notebook and hopefully more!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on more or less anything fun and interesting that you would be willing to help me learn along the way!
- 📫 If you want to reach me, my work email is probably best -- tanner.nardone@gtri.gatech.edu
